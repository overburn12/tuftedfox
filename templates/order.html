    <h2>Image Guidelines for Custom Rugs</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the creative process at TuftedFox! When designing your personalized rug, it's important to choose the right kind of image. Ideal images for rug creation are those with flat colors and without shading or gradients. We recommend avoiding intricate details, thin lines, or areas with excessive localized detail. Cartoon-style drawings or images with clear, bold lines translate beautifully into rug art. The larger the rug, the more detailed the representation can be, as each strand of yarn acts like a 'pixel' in your image. Our maximum rug size is 36 x 36 inches, offering a generous canvas for your artistic visions. Choose your image thoughtfully to ensure a stunning and timeless rug creation!</p>
