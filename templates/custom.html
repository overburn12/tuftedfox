        'When designing your personalized rug, it\'s important to choose the right kind of image. '
        'Ideal images for rug creation are those with flat colors and without shading or gradients. '
        'We recommend avoiding thin lines, or areas with excessive localized detail. '
        'Cartoon-style drawings or images with clear, bold lines translate beautifully into rug art. '
        'Choose your image thoughtfully to ensure a stunning and timeless rug creation!'

        'Larger rugs function like a canvas with more \'pixels,\' each strand of yarn capturing finer details of your image. '
        'Conversely, smaller rugs may not depict intricate details as effectively due to fewer yarn strands. '
        'Our maximum rug size of 36 x 36 inches allows for a detailed and vivid portrayal of your artistic visions, balancing image size and detail level optimally.'
